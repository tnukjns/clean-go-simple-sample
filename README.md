# Clean-Go-Simple-Sample
This repository contains two simple Go programs that output user IDs, highlighting the contrast between the Clean Architecture approach and the non-Clean Architecture approach.

## Usage

To run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clean-go-simple-sample.git
cd clean-go-simple-sample
```

2. Run the second example, which uses Clean Architecture:
```
go run clean/print-userid.go 
```

3. Run the first example, which doesn't use Clean Architecture:
```
go run not-clean/print-userid.go 
```
